<h2>Command-line arguments</h2>
<p>As you already know, the <code>main</code> method is an entry point of every Java program.</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {}</code></pre>
<p>As it works as a usual method, it can receive some parameters via the <code>String[] args</code> part. But as it is
    the main method of the program, you can think of them as the whole program's arguments, so-called
    <strong>command-line arguments</strong>. So, here we will look closer at how these arguments are used.</p>

<h4>Different numbers of parameters + passing example</h4>
<p>There are different ways of providing command-line args to a program. For example, you can define them with your IDE
    tools or write them manually as a program run command parameters:</p>
<pre><code>java Main myArg</code></pre><p>We can pass a different number of parameters separating them with space and
    get the values in <code>main(...)</code> as array members:</p>
<pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
        System.out.println(args[1]);
    }
}</code></pre><p>Now if we compile the <code>Main</code> class from its directory with </p>
<pre><code>javac Main.java </code></pre><p>and then call it with two arguments we will get the expected output:</p>
<pre><code>java Main myFirstArg mySecondArg
myFirstArg
mySecondArg</code></pre><p> If we want to pass an argument that consists of multiple "words" separated by blank space,
    we must put such an argument in double quotes:</p>
<pre><code>java Main myFirstArg "multiple word arg"
myFirstArg
multiple word arg</code></pre><p>We don't have to pass any arguments, but the program will fail while trying to get an
    argument that was not provided:</p>
<pre><code>java Main
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
        at Main.main(Main.java:5)</code></pre>

<h4>Argument types</h4>
<p>The command-line arguments are always provided as an array of <code>Strings</code>. You can still pass number values,
    but they will be accepted as <code>Strings</code>. Casting to a number or whatever type you expect it to be should
    be done manually in the program:</p>
<pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        System.out.println("Provided number : " + i);
    }
}</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p> We are using standard output tools here to simplify the example. It is not the
    common way of logging/showing error information in real applications.</p></div><p>Now we need to recompile
    the class with <code>javac</code>.Then, if we test it with a correct integer value, it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>java Main 5
Provided number : 5</code></pre>

<h4>With or without arguments?</h4>
<p>What will happen, if there are two different <code>main</code> methods: with and without args? </p>
<pre><code>public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Method with arguments called!");
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }

    public static void main() {
        System.out.println("No arguments method called!");
    }
    
}</code></pre><p>If you recompile and try to call the program with empty arguments list and then with any argument, the
    first method will be called both times.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>It means, that in Java the <code>main</code> method always has to accept arguments,
    but you don't have to always provide them.</p></div><p>So, if your program requires no arguments, its
    <code>main</code> method still has to have <code>String[] args</code> as parameter. Java programmers are not allowed
    to change the type of <code>args</code> array as well: it has to be <code>String[]</code>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Now you know more about command-line arguments in Java. You can pass them to your program as <code>Strings</code> and
    handle them in the <code>main</code> method to make your application more flexible and configurable.It's time
    to revise what you have learned with some tasks!</p>
