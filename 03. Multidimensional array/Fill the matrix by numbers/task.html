<h2>Fill the matrix by numbers</h2>
<div>Wow! This problem is kind of tricky. If you're ready to put your thinking cap on, brace yourself, and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later.</div>
<p>Given the number <em>n</em>, not greater than 100, create a matrix of size <em>n</em>Ã—<em>n</em> and fill it using the following rule. Numbers 0 should be stored on the primary (main) diagonal. The two diagonals, adjacent to the primary one, should contain numbers 1. The next two diagonals should contain numbers 2; etc.</p>
<p><em>Note: the primary diagonal runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.</em></p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>5</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>0 1 2 3 4
