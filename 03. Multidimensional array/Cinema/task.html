<p>The cinema has <strong>n</strong> rows, each row consists of <strong>m</strong> seats (<strong>n</strong> and
    <strong>m</strong> do not exceed 20). A two-dimensional matrix stores the information on the sold tickets: the
    number <strong>1</strong> means that the ticket for this place is already sold, and the number <strong>0</strong>
    means that the place is available. You want to buy <strong>k</strong> tickets to neighboring seats in the same row.
    Find whether it can be done.</p>

<p><strong>Input data format</strong></p>

<p>On the input, the program gets the number of <strong>n</strong> rows and <strong>m</strong> seats. Then, there are n
    lines, each containing <strong>m</strong> numbers (<strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong>) separated by spaces.
    The last line contains the number <strong>k</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Output data format</strong></p>

<p>The program should output the number of the row with <strong>k</strong> consecutive available seats. If there are
    several rows with <strong>k</strong> available seats, output the first row with these seats. If there is no such a
    row, output the number 0.</p>
